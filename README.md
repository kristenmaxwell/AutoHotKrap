# AutoHotKrap
a place to put my AutoHotKey stuff

Currently has just one file, containing my AHK scripts for use with Adobe Premiere CC 2017.

Current features:
1. Play Head and Tail - for reviewing how an inserted clip meshes with the clips on either side. 
2. Ripple Cut - copies the current selection, then ripple deletes it. Useful for moving clips around the timeline.
3. My general key rebindings for editing on a laptop. basically ALT+number keys = Numpad number keys Useful for jumping to specific timecodes, since Adobe doesn't see fit to let us rebind this function.
