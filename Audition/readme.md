welcome to my AHK script for Adobe Audition. I've created the following basic funcionality:

  1. the ability to "nudge" a time selection forward or back, using the keyboard
  2. the ability to "drag" a time selection around like you would with the mouse, using only the keyboard
  
  You'll need AutoHotKey in order to run this script. Get it here: https://autohotkey.com/
